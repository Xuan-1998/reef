"""The result bundle: what a finished CORAL x Reef run leaves behind.

Issue #3's Done-when asks the bundle for score-over-time, the best artifact,
model/skill versions, token/cost accounting, and enough metadata to replay
the run. All of it derives from two artifacts this example already produces:
the attribution journal (per-call: agent, commit, release id, token usage)
and the sequence of finalized attempt reports (per-attempt: score, status,
lineage). The builder is pure — inputs in, JSON-serializable dict out — so
it runs after the fact on any journal+reports pair, including one recovered
from a crashed run.
